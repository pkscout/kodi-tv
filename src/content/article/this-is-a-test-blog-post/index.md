So, here are some words. You can format them using the WYSIWYG editor, or you can hack around with markdown.

You've got the usual suspects:

**Bold**

*Italic*

`Code`

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

Plus, quotes:

> So, so you think you can tell\
> Heaven from hell?\
> Blue skies from pain?\
> Can you tell a green field\
> From a cold steel rail?\
> A smile from a veil?\
> Do you think you can tell?

And the usual mangled list formatting:

* bullets

  * bullets

    * bullets

      * bullets
    * bullets
  * bullets
* bullets

1. Numbered lists
2. Numbered lists

   1. Numbered lists
   2. Numbered lists
3. Numbered lists

**Code block (with code types):**

```c
#ifndef _STDIO_H_
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#define _STDIO_H_

#define _FSTDIO                 /* ``function stdio'' */

#define __need_size_t
#include <stddef.h>

#define __need___va_list
#include <stdarg.h>
```
